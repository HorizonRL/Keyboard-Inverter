# Keyboard-Inverter

If you are using two languages on your keyboard you probably know and suffer from the problem this project solves. 

As you type passionately something in X language and once you lock away from the keyboard you see that you typed it in the wrong language.

This project solves this annoying issue, all you need to do is run it and it will invert the chars to the QWERTY preset of the language.
If you have a smart mouse you can connect the Batch file to one of the mouse buttons.

**Be aware:**
1. For now it's support only English an Hebrew.
2. Change the batch inner dict.
